It bridges Ethereum and Substrate ecosystems through:\n- EigenLayer AVS integration for security\n- Snowbridge for cross-chain communication\n- Frontier pallets for EVM compatibility\n- External validators with rewards system\n\n## Critical Development Commands\n\n### E2E Testing Environment (from `/test` directory)\n\n```bash\n# Setup\nbun i                               # Install dependencies\nbun cli                            # Interactive CLI for test environment\n\n# Code Quality\nbun fmt:fix                        # Fix TypeScript formatting\nbun typecheck                      # TypeScript type checking\n\n# Code Generation (run after contract changes)\nbun generate:wagmi                 # Generate TypeScript contract bindings\nbun generate:types                 # Generate Polkadot-API types from runtime\n\n# Local Development\nbun build:docker:operator          # Build local DataHaven Docker image\nbun start:e2e:local               # Launch local test network\nbun stop:e2e                      # Stop all test services\n\n# Testing\nbun test:e2e                      # Run E2E test suite\n```\n\n### Rust/Operator Development\n\n```bash\ncd operator\ncargo build --release --features fast-runtime    # Development build\ncargo test                                       # Run tests\n```\n\n### Smart Contracts (from `/contracts` directory)\n\n```bash\nforge build                        # Build contracts\nforge test                         # Run tests\nforge fmt                          # Format Solidity code\n```\n\n## Architecture Essentials\n\n### Cross-Component Dependencies\n- **Contracts → Operator**: DataHaven AVS contracts register operators and manage slashing\n- **Operator → Contracts**: Operator reads validator registry from contracts\n- **Test → Both**: E2E tests deploy contracts and run operator nodes\n- **Snowbridge**: Enables native token transfers and message passing between chains\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n1. **Service Manager Pattern**: Contracts use EigenLayer's service manager for operator coordination\n2. **Rewards Registry**: Tracks validator performance and distributes rewards\n3. **Slashing Mechanisms**: Enforces protocol rules through economic penalties\n4. **Runtime Upgrades**: Substrate's forkless upgrade system for protocol evolution\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- **Unit Tests**: In each component directory\n- **Integration Tests**: E2E tests in `/test` that spin up full networks\n- **Kurtosis**: Manages complex multi-container test environments\n- **Contract Verification**: Automated on Blockscout in test networks\n\n### Development Workflow\n1. Make changes to relevant component\n2. Run component-specific tests\n3. If changing contracts, regenerate TypeScript bindings\n4. Build Docker image if testing operator changes\n5. Run E2E tests to verify cross-component interactions\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- Always regenerate types after runtime changes (`bun generate:types`)\n- E2E tests require Kurtosis engine running\n- Contract changes require regenerating Wagmi bindings\n- Snowbridge relayers need proper configuration for cross-chain tests\n- Use `fast-runtime` feature for quicker development cycles\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n      \n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.

Be sure to adhere to these instructions. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.\n\nContents of /workspace/datahaven/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nDataHaven is an EVM-compatible Substrate blockchain secured by EigenLayer. It bridges Ethereum and Substrate ecosystems through:\n- EigenLayer AVS integration for security\n- Snowbridge for cross-chain communication\n- Frontier pallets for EVM compatibility\n- External validators with rewards system\n\n## Critical Development Commands\n\n### E2E Testing Environment (from `/test` directory)\n\n```bash\n# Setup\nbun i                               # Install dependencies\nbun cli                            # Interactive CLI for test environment\n\n# Code Quality\nbun fmt:fix                        # Fix TypeScript formatting\nbun typecheck                      # TypeScript type checking\n\n# Code Generation (run after contract changes)\nbun generate:wagmi                 # Generate TypeScript contract bindings\nbun generate:types                 # Generate Polkadot-API types from runtime\n\n# Local Development\nbun build:docker:operator          # Build local DataHaven Docker image\nbun start:e2e:local               # Launch local test network\nbun stop:e2e                      # Stop all test services\n\n# Testing\nbun test:e2e                      # Run E2E test suite\n```\n\n### Rust/Operator Development\n\n```bash\ncd operator\ncargo build --release --features fast-runtime    # Development build\ncargo test                                       # Run tests\n```\n\n### Smart Contracts (from `/contracts` directory)\n\n```bash\nforge build                        # Build contracts\nforge test                         # Run tests\nforge fmt                          # Format Solidity code\n```\n\n## Architecture Essentials\n\n### Cross-Component Dependencies\n- **Contracts → Operator**: DataHaven AVS contracts register operators and manage slashing\n- **Operator → Contracts**: Operator reads validator registry from contracts\n- **Test → Both**: E2E tests deploy contracts and run operator nodes\n- **Snowbridge**: Enables native token transfers and message passing between chains\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n1. **Service Manager Pattern**: Contracts use EigenLayer's service manager for operator coordination\n2. **Rewards Registry**: Tracks validator performance and distributes rewards\n3. **Slashing Mechanisms**: Enforces protocol rules through economic penalties\n4. **Runtime Upgrades**: Substrate's forkless upgrade system for protocol evolution\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- **Unit Tests**: In each component directory\n- **Integration Tests**: E2E tests in `/test` that spin up full networks\n- **Kurtosis**: Manages complex multi-container test environments\n- **Contract Verification**: Automated on Blockscout in test networks\n\n### Development Workflow\n1. Make changes to relevant component\n2. Run component-specific tests\n3. If changing contracts, regenerate TypeScript bindings\n4. Build Docker image if testing operator changes\n5. Run E2E tests to verify cross-component interactions\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- Always regenerate types after runtime changes (`bun generate:types`)\n- E2E tests require Kurtosis engine running\n- Contract changes require regenerating Wagmi bindings\n- Snowbridge relayers need proper configuration for cross-chain tests\n- Use `fast-runtime` feature for quicker development cycles\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n      \n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task. Most of the time, it is not relevant.\n</system-reminder>\n",
