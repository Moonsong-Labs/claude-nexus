It uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling and Framer Motion for animations.\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n```bash\n# Development\nnpm run dev          # Start Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173\n\n# Building\nnpm run build        # Type check with tsc then build with Vite\nnpm run preview      # Preview production build locally\n\n# Code Quality\nnpm run lint         # Run ESLint\nnpm run format       # Format code with Prettier\nnpm run format:check # Check if formatting is needed\n```\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture with:\n\n- **Pages**: Located in `src/pages/`, currently contains landing-page components\n- **Components**: Reusable UI components in `src/components/`, organized by feature (Hero, Navbar, ServiceCard, Services)\n- **Data Models**: Service definitions and types in `src/data/services.ts`\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin, global styles in `src/index.css`\n- **Animations**: Framer Motion for interactive animations\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n- **React 19.1.0**: Latest React version with TypeScript support\n- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, project references setup with separate configs for app and node environments\n- **Tailwind CSS v4**: New plugin-based approach via `@tailwindcss/vite`\n- **ESLint**: Modern flat config with TypeScript and React plugins\n- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n1. All TypeScript files must pass type checking before build\n2. Code formatting is enforced via Prettier\n3. ESLint checks for code quality and React best practices\n4. Components should be organized by feature in the components directory\n5. Page-level components go in the pages directory\n\n## Visual Testing Workflow\n\nWhen making UI changes, ALWAYS:\n\n1. Ensure dev server is running (`npm run dev`)\n2. Run `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state\n3. Use the Read tool to examine screenshots in `/screenshots/`:\n   - `hero-section.png` - Hero section with Get Started button\n   - `hero-hover.png` - Button hover state\n   - `services-section.png` - Services display with icons\n   - `full-page.png` - Complete page view\n4. Verify visual changes match intended design\n5. Check for regressions in animations, colors, and layouts\n\n## Git Workflow Guidelines\n\nWhen working with git in this repository:\n\n1. **Always start from main**: Before creating a new feature branch, ALWAYS:\n\n   - `git checkout main`\n   - `git pull` to get the latest changes\n   - Then create your new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch-name`\n\n2. **Format code before committing**: ALWAYS run `npm run format` before committing changes to ensure consistent code style\n\n3. **No Claude attribution in commits**: When committing changes:\n   - Write commit messages that focus on what changed, not who made the changes\n   - Do NOT include \"Generated with Claude Code\" or similar attributions\n   - Do NOT add Co-Authored-By lines for Claude\n   - Keep commit messages professional and focused on the code changes\n\n## Reference Files\n\nWhen working with design references or mockups:\n\n- Upload all reference images to the `references/` directory\n- This directory is gitignored to keep the repository clean\n- Reference files should be used for implementation guidance but not committed to the repository\n\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n      \n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task. Most of the time, it is not relevant.\n</system-reminder>\n",
