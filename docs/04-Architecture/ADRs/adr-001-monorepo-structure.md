# ADR-001: Monorepo Structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Claude Nexus Proxy project consists of multiple interconnected services: a proxy API service, a monitoring dashboard, shared utilities, and various scripts. We need to decide how to organize these components in a way that promotes code reuse, simplifies dependency management, and maintains clear boundaries between services.

## Decision Drivers

- **Code Reuse**: Share common types, utilities, and configurations
- **Independent Deployment**: Services should be deployable separately
- **Developer Experience**: Easy to understand and navigate
- **Build Performance**: Efficient builds and hot reloading
- **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript types across services

## Considered Options

1. **Separate Repositories**
   - Description: Each service in its own Git repository
   - Pros: Complete independence, clear boundaries, separate CI/CD
   - Cons: Complex dependency management, code duplication, harder to maintain consistency

2. **Single Application**
   - Description: All code in one application with different entry points
   - Pros: Simple structure, easy sharing
   - Cons: Can't deploy services independently, mixing concerns, larger deployment artifacts

3. **Monorepo with Workspaces**
   - Description: Single repository with separate packages using Bun workspaces
   - Pros: Code sharing, independent services, unified tooling, atomic commits
   - Cons: More complex initial setup, requires workspace-aware tooling

## Decision

We will use a **monorepo structure with Bun workspaces**, organizing the codebase as follows:

```
claude-nexus/
├── packages/shared/      # Shared types and utilities
├── services/
│   ├── proxy/           # Proxy API service
│   └── dashboard/       # Dashboard web service
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts
├── docker/              # Docker configurations
└── docs/               # Documentation
```

### Implementation Details

Root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "claude-nexus-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "services/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"bun run dev:proxy\" \"bun run dev:dashboard\"",
    "dev:proxy": "cd services/proxy && bun run dev",
    "dev:dashboard": "cd services/dashboard && bun run dev",
    "build": "bun run build:shared && bun run build:services",
    "build:shared": "cd packages/shared && bun run build",
    "build:services": "concurrently \"cd services/proxy && bun run build\" \"cd services/dashboard && bun run build\""
  }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Shared Code**: Types, configurations, and utilities are easily shared via `@claude-nexus/shared`
- **Independent Services**: Each service can be built and deployed separately
- **Unified Development**: Single `bun install` installs all dependencies
- **Atomic Changes**: Related changes across services can be committed together
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types flow naturally between packages

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: Developers need to understand workspace structure
- **Build Order**: Must build shared packages before services
- **Tooling Requirements**: Some tools may not fully support workspaces

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Accidental coupling between services
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce that services only communicate via APIs, not direct imports

- **Risk**: Large repository size over time
  - **Mitigation**: Use Git LFS for large files, regularly clean up old artifacts

## Notes

This structure allows us to maintain separate Docker images for each service while sharing code effectively. The monorepo approach has proven successful for many large-scale projects and aligns well with our need for rapid development while maintaining service independence.
