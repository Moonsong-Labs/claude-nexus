# ADR-004: Proxy-Level Authentication with Domain-Specific API Keys

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Claude Nexus Proxy initially operated as an open relay, forwarding any request to the Claude API as long as the domain had valid Claude credentials. This created security risks:

- Anyone knowing the proxy endpoint could use it
- No way to revoke access without changing Claude API keys
- No audit trail of who is using the proxy
- Potential for abuse and unexpected costs

We needed a way to authenticate clients at the proxy level while maintaining backward compatibility and not requiring changes to existing Claude API client libraries.

## Decision Drivers

- **Security**: Prevent unauthorized proxy usage
- **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing deployments
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand
- **Standards Compliance**: Use established authentication patterns
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead on request processing
- **Flexibility**: Support different authentication needs per domain

## Considered Options

1. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Description: Allow only specific IP addresses
   - Pros: Simple, no client changes needed
   - Cons: Inflexible, breaks with dynamic IPs, hard to manage

2. **OAuth/JWT Tokens**
   - Description: Full OAuth flow with JWT tokens
   - Pros: Industry standard, supports rotation, fine-grained permissions
   - Cons: Complex implementation, requires client changes, overkill for proxy auth

3. **HTTP Basic Authentication**
   - Description: Username/password in Authorization header
   - Pros: Simple, widely supported
   - Cons: Credentials visible in logs, less secure than Bearer tokens

4. **Custom Header Authentication**
   - Description: Custom header like `X-Proxy-Key`
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Non-standard, harder to integrate with existing tools

5. **Bearer Token Authentication**
   - Description: Standard Bearer token in Authorization header
   - Pros: OAuth 2.0 standard, secure, widely supported
   - Cons: Requires key management

## Decision

We will implement **Bearer Token Authentication** with domain-specific API keys stored in credential files.

### Implementation Details

1. **Authentication Flow**:

   ```
   Client → Proxy: Authorization: Bearer cnp_live_xxx...
   Proxy: Extract domain from Host header
   Proxy: Load credentials/<domain>.credentials.json
   Proxy: Compare tokens using timing-safe SHA-256
   Proxy → Claude: Forward if authenticated
   ```

2. **Credential Structure**:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "api_key",
     "accountId": "acc_unique_id",
     "api_key": "sk-ant-...", // Claude API key
     "client_api_key": "cnp_live_..." // Proxy auth key
   }
   ```

3. **Security Measures**:
   - SHA-256 hashing before comparison (timing-safe)
   - Domain validation to prevent path traversal
   - No fallback to default credentials
   - WWW-Authenticate header on 401 responses

4. **Key Format**:
   - Prefix: `cnp_live_` for production, `cnp_test_` for testing
   - Body: 32 bytes of cryptographically secure random data
   - Encoding: Base64URL (URL-safe, no padding)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Enhanced Security**: Only authorized clients can use the proxy
- **Per-Domain Control**: Each domain has independent authentication
- **Standards Compliance**: Uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer token standard
- **Audit Trail**: All authentication attempts are logged
- **Backward Compatible**: Can be disabled via `ENABLE_CLIENT_AUTH=false`
- **No Client Library Changes**: Works with standard HTTP Authorization header

### Negative

- **Key Management**: Additional keys to generate and distribute
- **No Built-in Rotation**: Manual process to rotate keys
- **Single Key per Domain**: No support for multiple keys per domain
- **No Rate Limiting**: Authentication doesn't include rate limiting

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Leaked client API keys
  - **Mitigation**: Keys can be revoked by updating credential files
  - **Mitigation**: Keys are domain-specific, limiting blast radius

- **Risk**: Timing attacks on key comparison
  - **Mitigation**: SHA-256 hashing ensures constant-time comparison

- **Risk**: Path traversal attacks
  - **Mitigation**: Domain validation and path sanitization

## Implementation Notes

- Introduced in PR #2
- Two new middleware components: `domainExtractorMiddleware` and `clientAuthMiddleware`
- 11 test cases with 91.53% code coverage
- Script provided for key generation: `scripts/generate-api-key.ts`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation with grace period
2. **Multiple Keys**: Support multiple valid keys per domain
3. **Key Expiration**: Time-limited keys
4. **Rate Limiting**: Per-key rate limiting
5. **API Key Management**: API endpoints for key management
