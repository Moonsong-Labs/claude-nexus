## Context

```

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template from `template.md`
2. Name it `adr-XXX-brief-description.md` where XXX is the next number
3. Fill in all sections
4. Update this README with the new ADR
5. Submit PR for review

## Reviewing ADRs

When reviewing an ADR, consider:

- Is the context clearly explained?
- Are alternatives considered?
- Are trade-offs documented?
- Are the consequences realistic?
- Is the decision actionable?

## Superseding ADRs

When an ADR is superseded:

1. Update the original ADR status to "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
2. Link to the new ADR
3. Explain in the new ADR why the original decision is being changed
